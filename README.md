Which GCM-RCM combination(s) and ensemble method is more/the most accurate to represent
the monthly temperature and precipitation patterns of observed areas and also the
whole world? The quality and capability of further efforts like future projections, heat
wave analysis and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) calculations in this thesis
depends on the accuracy of GCMs and RCMs.
In this methodology, proposed
methodology to find the answer to this research question in this thesis objects to this
claim and also offers a more appropriate approach to use in climate studies. The errors
of the grid points in the observed regions are not neglected by averaging and the
accurate GCM-RCM combinations are selected by taking into account all of the errors
in grid points. The distribution of the errors are portrayed and translated into basic
mathematical/statistical equations. This is the first advantage of our methodology
The advantage of our methodology is that it shows the success of RCMs and
GCMs over various regions to the scientific world. By this way, further improvements
and developments can be carried out by analyzing the errors and the reasons behind
these errors of climate models in the unsuccessful areas. The leading factors behind
the errors over unsuccessful areas can be determined by analyzing the climatology of
the unsuccessful areas in detail. Another advantage of our methodology is determining
the best RCM-GCM combinations over specific areas for researchers. By this means,
they may determine the models which give reliable outcomes and the ones which risk
their research.
2050s (the period between 2036 and 2065) and 2080s ( the period between 2066 and 2095) 
are chosen as the future periods. The temperature and precipitation alterations in these
periods with respect to reference period (between 1976 and 2005) are analyzed via this
methodology and the most representative GCM-RCM combinations.
